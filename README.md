# GraphQL-Intro
An introduction to GraphQL and Apollo.

### Installation

Clone the repository and run ```npm install``` in both the intro and intermediate directories. Run ```npm run start``` to start the GraphQL server in the desired module.
For students in my breakout sessions, checkout the start branch to begin.

### Further practice in the intermediate directory
- create resolvers for our User schema.
- authenticate our User and pass the authenticated user into the query/mutation (hint: context)
- create books associated to each user
